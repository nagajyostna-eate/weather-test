# weather-test



Installations :

install java 
install aplugin "geckodriver" if the browser does not open , here we are using Firefox 
and change the path in java file webHelper


import bdd scripts and click omn run 



Run Highlights:

Run file "RunFeature"

tags are used to restrict test case execution.



Improvements

Better report generations 
group all Given , when , then , And functions in one java file
group all the reusable functional in one java file , so that functions can be reused. 
if we use Java 8 , string validations will be much easier
group all the global variable in common properties eg : Sleep , Url ( so it is easier to change the URl depending of the environment tested )
can test for multiple browsers



testing coverage 
Can cover more edge cases - but no enough time to coverage 


Req Not clear: 
Daily forecast should summarise the 3 hour data:  - not sure what are the calculation used in the application but for rounding down have to use -  Math.floor
